Youtube shorts are not autoscrollable when one short is comepleted user have to scroll to next
with arrow down button on keyboard or mouse scroll

I guess we can make extension which can autoscroll youtube shorts 

buy the way there is already a extension exists but its UI/UX is not good we can make it better with more options like download current short as there are some website which are doing same but they require shorts link
User have to copy the link and paste it in that website and then download 

we can also add some features like make video faster or slower 1.5x or -1.5x
