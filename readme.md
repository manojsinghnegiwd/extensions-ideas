with arrow down button on keyboard or mouse scroll

I guess we can make extension which can autoscroll youtube shorts 

buy the way there is already an extension exists but its UI/UX is not good we can make it better.

> Existing extension
> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-youtube-shorts-scrol/elggcfikfbaijgcofcapgeahjaclpfnf


Also we can add more options like download current short as there are some website which are doing same but they require shorts link
User have to copy the link and paste it in that website and then download 

> Download shorts
> https://shortsnoob.com/

we can also add some features like make video faster or slower 1.5x or -1.5x

* Time Tracker: A Chrome extension that tracks how much time you spend on each website, so you can better manage your time and productivity.
